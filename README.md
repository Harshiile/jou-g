## The Real-World Problem

### Traditional Flow (Time-wasting and Error-prone) :

- A **YouTuber** records a raw video (around X GB)
- They send it to an **Editor**, who edits and returns the final version - estimated X GB
- The **YouTuber** then :
  - Downloads the final file/video
  - Reviews it locally
  - Manually uploads it to YouTube
- If re-editing is needed, this entire process repeats
- Problems arise :
  - Uploads are slow or fail on weak internet
  - Entire workflow depends on manual steps
  - Hours wasted just transferring files back and forth
  - If re-edits needed, still youtuber have to download video, then suggest the re-edits

The result? Broken workflows, missed deadlines, and fatigue for both creators and editors
